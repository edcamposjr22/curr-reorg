= Intro to Functions

== Facilitation

Students will be able to:

* Write examples for functions
* Write functions using the Design Recipe
* Trouble shoot their errors

== Big Idea

Students will be able to write functions in Racket using the design recipe.

== Key Points

* Students understand function design in terms of contracts
* Students learn how to write examples for functions
* Students learn how to go from examples to the function abstraction

== Guiding Questions

* How can we save time when we have to do a repetitive task?
* When using the Design Recipe; What changes? What stays the same?


== Implementation Guidelines

* Students must be familiar with image functions and arithmetic to complete this activity
* Students must be familiar with defining and using variables to complete this lesson
