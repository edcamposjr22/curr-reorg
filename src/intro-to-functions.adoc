= Intro to Functions

*Students will learn to write functions in Racket using The Design Recipe*


[.left-header,cols=“20a,80a”, stripes=none]
|===
|Lesson Goals
|Students will be able to:

* Understand The Design Recipe process of writing functions(and using it to break down word problems).
* Write the contract using & domain and range.

|Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can describe the domain and range of a function.
* I can write the contract and the purpose statement for a function.
* I can write 2 examples for a function given a contract.
* I can define a function based on what changes and what stays the same, given 2 examples of what the function does. 
* I can give my function appropriate variable names.

|Key Points for the Facilitator
|
* There are 3 parts to the Design Recipe structure that students need to become comfortable using; 
The Contract
The Examples
The Definition.
* When writing out Examples & selecting sample inputs, have students reference the Domain & Range in the Contract. 
* After writing 2 examples & before the Definition is written, it’s very important to have students look at their examples to circle and label what is changing.
Emphasizing the circle & label step directly aids in writing the Definition because they can just bring down all the code and replace the sample inputs with the label for their variable name.

|Prerequisites

== Get Ready:

Students should have their computer, contracts page, and pencil.

== Launch: I love Green Triangles! (5 mins)

Start off by telling students how much you love green triangles. Big Triangles, small Triangles, medium-sized Triangles, you love them all! 

In the Definitions window, have students create as many different sized triangles as they can 2 minutes. 

[.notice-box]Notice and Wonder
Ask students to take a minute to see what they notice about the lines of code.
Discuss as a group.
Ask students to take a minute to see what they wonder about the lines of code.
Share and discuss again.

== Discuss: (2 mins)
*What stayed the same and what changed in all the triangle lines of code?
*Do you think there might be a shortcut?


== Explore: (10 min)

In partners, Have students open the “Green Triangle” file and read the commented instructions in the Interactions window. 

Have students explore the following functions by testing them out in the Interactions window:
*gt
*green-triangle
*red-star
*rs


[.strategy-box]
.Strategies for English Language Learners
****MLR 6 - 3 Reads: 
*1st Read - Read the Word Problem to them without showing it to them and have them discuss what the problem is about and a possible strategy.
*2nd Read: In Pairs, have student A read the problem and then they discuss what functions they might be using to solve this problem.
*3rd Read: Student B reads the problem and then they come up with a good purpose statement.

****

== Discuss: (10 min)

Introduce the Design Recipe as a way to write functions in order to take shortcuts when ther are repetitive tasks(connect to MP Look for and Make Use of Structure & MP8: Look for and Express Regularity in Repeated Reasoning?).

As you introducing the different parts of The Design Recipe, here are some questions to ask:
*What is the Contract for the ‘triangle’ function? Domain/Range?
*What should the Contract for ‘green-triangle’ or ‘gt’? Domain/Range?
*Can you model the examples using the Circles of Evaluation?



== Practice: (10 min)

Practice the Design Recipe

*Write bc, which takes a size and makes a blue circle of the given size
*What other functions can you write that produce geometric shapes and can be configured with a variable?


== Create/Apply: (5 min)

Have students use The Design Recipe to write a function that:
*Has a function name that conveys the function purpose to other users: Examples, blue-circle, bc, green-triangle, or gt, etc..
*Takes in a number as the input
*Produces a shape of their choosing that is:
*Either “solid” or “outline” - Their choice
*A a color of their choosing
