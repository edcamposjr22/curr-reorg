= Linear Word Problems(Mathematical Modeling

*Students will learn three how to model a linear equation 
in the Racket Language using The Design Recipe.*


[.left-header,cols=“20a,80a”, stripes=none]
|===
|Lesson Goals
|Students will be able to:

* Write the contract, at least two examples, and a function definition given a word problem
* Take a continuous word problem in one or two variables and turn it into a function using the design recipe.


|Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can describe the domain and range of a function, given a word problem.
*I can write the contract and the purpose statement for a function, given a word problem.
*I can write 2 examples of a function
*I can define a function based on what changes and what remains the same in my examples.
*I can give my function appropriate variable names.


|Key Points for the Facilitator
|
* TAll steps of the design recipe are helpful for planning out our function
*Writing examples helps us catch mistakes
*Circling the things that change between examples helps us tell which parts of the calculation are variables
*Contracts are especially important in this lesson - students should have their contracts page open and be able to figure out why they can’t combine three images at once.
*If students struggle with writing their examples, you can suggest they try modeling their  examples with a Circles of Evaluation mapping.


|Prerequisites
|
* Students  must be familiar with The Design Recipe for this activity.

== Get Ready:

Students should have their computer, contracts page, and pencil.

== Launch: Globo Gym (5 mins)

Watch this commercial for Globo Gym.


== Discuss: (5 mins)
*How many of you go to the gym?
*How much does it cost to go to the gym?
*What does pricing structure look like?
*Does it depend on the time of year? Why?
*What factors go into deciding which gym to sign up for?

== Explore: (10 min)
Research some local gyms and find out what the pricing structure is of each gym.  If you are pressed for time, you can gather the information of local gyms before-hand,  link them in a Google Doc or Google Classroom, and assign different groups to research certain gyms of the ones you have provided.


== Discuss: (10 min)

Gather the gym names, pricing, and pros/cons into a table as a class.



[.notice-box]Notice and Wonder
Ask students to take a minute to see what they notice about the lines of code.
Discuss as a group.
Ask students to take a minute to see what they wonder about the lines of code.
Share and discuss again.

.Strategies for English Language Learners
****MLR 7 - Compare and Connect: 
Highlight the similarities and differences between the different gym membership pricing structures and the pros/cons of attending each gym.

== Practice: (10 min)

Practice the Design Recipe

*Write bc, which takes a size and makes a blue circle of the given size
*What other functions can you write that produce geometric shapes and can be configured with a variable?


== Create/Apply: (5 min)

Take one of your local gyms and create a function ‘GymName’ that takes in the number of months and returns the cost of the membership of attending that amount of months.

*An Input/Output Table
*Racket Code
*2 Examples using Circles of Evaluation
